# Angie's Prework Study Guide

## Description

This Prework Study guide was created for boot camp students who are going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. 

- My motivation is that I am finally taking what I have wanted to do for a long time and I am putting it into practice. I am going to put the work into it.
- This project provided me with an outline and introduction to the growth mindset and the logic that goes into becoming a web developer and overall computer programmer. 
- This solved my organizational issue into putting content in a readable and presentable web page.
- I learned the introductory basics of what it takes to create a functioning web page.
